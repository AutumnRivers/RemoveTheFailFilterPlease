# PRTFF (Please Remove The Fail Filter)
...because it is very distracting.

---

A [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) plugin that removes the slightly reddish filter when you miss a note in [Overpass](https://store.steampowered.com/app/773740/Overpass/), because it is very distracting to me. (Also prevents the "eye"/HUD from turning red, too.)

**NOTE**: This does __**NOT**__ prevent failures! It only removes the visual effect.

### Why?
Because it always breaks my flow. Hate it. Got rid of it.
